A Minesweeper-esque game
By: Michael Whitaker

This is a game programmed in React that mimics the game Minesweeper. It does not have the full functionality
 of the original game, but several of the major features are present. The goal of the game is to click on the
 squares of the game board without clicking on the mines directly. When a space is clicked, it reveals the
 number of mines that are in the squares bordering it. This should allow the user to deduce which squares are
 mines and which are not. When the user identifies a square as a mine, he or she can right click to mark it 
 as a mine. This prevents the user from clicking on it by accident. Successfully clearing all empty squares wins the game.

User Stories:
1. AS AN experienced gamer, I WANT TO play the classic minesweeper game SO THAT I don't have to pay for it.
2. AS A kid on a long trip, I WANT something to occupy my time SO THAT I don't drive my parents crazy.
3. AS A father working from home during the pandemic, I WANT a kid-friendly game SO THAT I can do my job while
  while my kids are home with me.

 Technologies Used: ReactJS, JavaScript, CSS, HTML.

 Ideas for Improvement:
 1. Needs a tutorial for beginners.
 2. Needs more customization options, such as ability to control the size of the board
 3. The images in the background of buttons can be improved
 4. More functionality can be added later, such as a double-click to reveal all empty spaces in the vicinity
